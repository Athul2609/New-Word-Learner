# GRE Vocabulary Learning Tool

## Introduction

This Python code serves as a valuable tool to aid in the learning of new words encountered while studying for the GRE (Graduate Record Examination). The code offers a randomized way to revise and reinforce the meanings of these words, ensuring a deeper understanding of their definitions and usage.

## How It Works

The primary objective of this code is to help users memorize the true meanings of words rather than simply memorizing them in a specific order. The code randomly selects words from the chosen day(s) of study, allowing users to focus on the meanings of individual words without the influence of their learning sequence.

## Features

- **Random Selection:** The code randomly selects words from specific days, ensuring that you're not memorizing the meanings based on their order of study.

- **Focused Learning:** By focusing on individual words' meanings rather than their sequence, you can gain a more solid grasp of their definitions and usage.

- **Customizable Revision:** You can choose to revise words from specific days of study, tailoring your revision to your learning needs.

## Benefits

- **True Understanding:** Learning the meanings of words in random order helps you truly understand the definitions, preventing you from associating meanings with their sequence.

- **Enhanced Retention:** Randomized revision enhances your ability to recall words' meanings, as you're not relying on a specific order.

- **Long-Term Learning:** This method promotes long-term retention, ensuring that you remember the meanings of words beyond a memorization exercise.

## Instructions

1. Run the Python code on your preferred environment.

2. Choose the day(s) you want to revise words from. The code will randomly select words from the selected days.

3. Click a button or press a key to reveal the meaning of a randomly chosen word.

4. Try to recall the word's meaning before revealing it, and then confirm your understanding.

## Conclusion

This GRE Vocabulary Learning Tool provides an effective and efficient way to learn and retain the meanings of new words encountered during GRE preparation. By focusing on the true meanings rather than their order of study, you'll be better equipped to use these words confidently and accurately in various contexts.
